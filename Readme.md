# TARPG
TARPG (Tactical ARPG) is a prototype of a game made in [Python](https://github.com/SkyMocha/TARPG) with a C++ demo. 

Python was inevitable chosen as the main platform due to ease of prototyping. The other reason C++ was dropped is due to my lack of knowledge with the language, therefore I could not leverage it's optimization strengths. 

Both prototypes use [TCOD](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a base.

A full journal of the game's development (including video demos) can be found [here](https://www.skymocha.net/Projects/TARPG/).

## Current Functionality
* Rendering
* Basic world-generation

## Why open-source?
I am open-sourcing this project along with others due to the fact I will never complete them. In the end, these prototypes are just me messing around and having fun! Hopefully they're of some use to you, or just a fun thing to look at :)
